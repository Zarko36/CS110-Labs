# NYT Popular Articles App

This app displays the top 5 most popular articles from the New York Times based on time period (day, week, month) and popularity criteria (most viewed, shared, emailed).

## Implementation Details

* The app uses the NYT Popular Article API to fetch articles.
* The API key is stored in a separate file (api-key.js) for security purposes.
* The app uses Fetch API to make GET requests to the NYT API.
* The app uses async/await syntax for easier error handling.
* The app uses try/catch blocks to handle errors when accessing article media.
* The app is responsive to screen width using Bootstrap's grid system.
